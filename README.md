# Python Course

This is a repository for a Python course that I am taking. Here you will find the lessons, exercises, and code examples from Luís Otávio Miranda's course on UDEMY.

## Contents

The course is divided into different sections, each with its own set of lessons and exercises. The current content includes:

Introduction to Python (Programming Logic)
- Section 1:
    - Lessons
    - Exercises
    - Test

Intermediate Python (Functional Programming)
- Section 2:
    - Lessons
    - Exercises
    - Test
    - 
Object Oriented Python (POO)
- Section 2:
    - Lessons
    - Exercises
    - Test
As I progress in the course, I will add more sections!

Each module contains a folder with the corresponding lessons and exercises. Additionally, there is a "tests" folder (not included yet) that contains some code examples for reference purposes.

## How to Use

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and navigate to the folder corresponding to the module you want to study. Inside each module folder, you will find a "lessons" folder and an "exercises" folder.

The files are available in code format. The exercises are presented as Python files that you should fill in and save with the corresponding solutions.
